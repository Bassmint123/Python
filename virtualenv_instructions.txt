virtualenv instructions

First make sure you have virtualenv installed
$ pip install virtualenv

Make sure you have a directory to keep the environments in
$ mkdir PyEnvironments   // let's use a directory called PyEnvironments for an example here

Next, go to that directory
cd PyEnvironments

Next, create a virtual environment called project1_env
$ virtualenv project1_env

To fire-up our new virtual environment we do the following
$ source project1_env/bin/activate

You can check to see if you are in the new environment
$ which python
$ which pip

If you do a pip list you will see there are virtually no site packages
$ pip list

You could install some packages
$ pip install [whatever package name]  // pytz, psutil, numpy,...etc. are good examples

You could do a pip list again to see if them listed out once they have been installed.

If we want to export this same set of packages to another environment, we could do this
$ pip freeze --local > requirements.txt

If you want to see the packages saved
$ cat requirements.txt

If we want to leave our current virtual environment
$ deactivate

At this point, the project1_env no longer shows up. Also, we can check with
$ which python

Also if we do a pip list, we would see all of our global packages
$ pip list
